# TPL Barcode Generator

TPL Barcode Generator is a tool that generates phone wallpapers that double as digital Toronto Public Library cards. A digital version of your library card can be useful if you want to lighten your wallet or avoid forgetting your physical card.

This tool was made using Remix and Flowbite, and is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. I'm currently in the process of recoding this project as a static application so that it can be hosted on Cloudflare CDN, for free.
