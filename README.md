# TPL Barcode Generator

TPL Barcode Generator is a tool that generates phone wallpapers that double as digital Toronto Public Library cards. A digital version of your library card can be useful if you want to lighten your wallet or avoid forgetting your physical card.

This repository contains the code for a version of TPL Barcode Generator that was built using Remix and Flowbite React. I rebuilt this app using JavaScript in order to take advantage of Cloudflare's free static website hosting.

JavaScript Version (Recommended):<br>[tplbarcode.com](https://tplbarcode.com/)

Remix Version:<br>
[tpl-barcode.pages.dev](https://tpl-barcode.pages.dev/)

## Hosting on TPL Barcode Generator on Cloudflare Pages

### TPL Barcode Generator - Remix Version

<div style="text-align: center;">

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant Origin Server
    participant Remix App

    User->>Origin Server: Request Webpage
    Origin Server->>Remix App: Request Webpage
    Remix App-->>Origin Server: Return Webpage
    Origin Server-->>User: Return Webpage

```

</div>

Remix uses server-side rendering to build webpages before serving them to the client. This can be very useful in many circumstances, but is not necessary for a simple tool like TPL Barcode Generator.

### TPL Barcode Generator - JavaScript Version

<div style="text-align: center;">

In the JavaScript version of TPL Barcode Generator, all application logic is performed by the user's browser. This allows the app to be hosted for free on Cloudflare Pages.
